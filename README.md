# EasyTSUtils
*Note: superseded by/split into: [DenoUtils](https://github.com/BOLL7708/DenoUtils) and [SharedUtils](https://github.com/BOLL7708/SharedUtils)*

Bespoke shared utilities for [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) projects running in [Deno](https://deno.com).

This is mainly used for my own personal projects, feel free to look at this as reference material, anything in here can change at any time as I adopt things to my own needs.
